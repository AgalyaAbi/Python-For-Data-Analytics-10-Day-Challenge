Day 7 – Statistics & Hypothesis Testing
🎯 Goal
To validate insights using statistical tests instead of relying only on visuals.

✅ Covered Topics
Descriptive Statistics (mean, std, mode)
Correlation (Sales, Profit, Discount)
One-Sample & Two-Sample t-tests
ANOVA (compare 3+ groups)
Chi-Square (categorical association)
Normality Check (Shapiro-Wilk test)


Key Learnings
Use t-tests & ANOVA to compare groups
Use Chi-square for categorical relationships
Use Shapiro to check distribution shape
p-value < 0.05 → statistically significant

📌 Takeaway

Day 7 helped in moving from “observing trends” → “validating insights”, ensuring business decisions are supported with evidence, not assumptions.
