📊 Day 3 – Sales Analytics Project
This project is part of my 10-Day Data Analytics Challenge where I explore real-world datasets and apply analytics techniques step by step.

Project Overview
On Day 3, I focused on advanced sales analytics using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) and a dynamic Excel report.
The goal is to analyze sales performance deeply and build business-ready insights.

📂 Dataset
The dataset includes:
Sales_ID – Unique transaction ID
Sale_Date – Date of sale
Product_ID & Product_Category
Region & Sales_Rep
Quantity
Sales_Amount

🔑 Key Analysis Performed
In Python

✔️ Pareto Analysis (80/20 Rule): Top products contributing to sales
✔️ Cumulative % Contribution of products
✔️ Monthly Sales Trend using time-series grouping
✔️ Sales by Category & Region with pivot tables
✔️ Recency Analysis (RFM Start) – Days since last purchase

📌 Insights

Few products drive the majority of sales (Pareto principle).
Regional and category differences reveal focus areas for growth.
Recency analysis highlights customer engagement trends.
Dynamic Excel report allows quick decision-making with actionable filters.

🔮 Next Steps (Day 4 Preview)
Move from descriptive analytics to predictive analytics by forecasting future sales using regression models.

✨ This is Day 3 of my 10-Day Sales Analytics Challenge.
