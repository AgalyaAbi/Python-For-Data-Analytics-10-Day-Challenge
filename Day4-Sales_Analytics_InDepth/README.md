📊 Day 4 – Advanced Sales Analytics with Python
In Day 4, I extended the analysisSales Data beyond simple descriptive insights and applied advanced analytics techniques.

🔑 Key Highlights
📈 Moving Averages (3 & 6 Month)
Smoothed sales trends using rolling averages.
Helps reduce noise and highlight long-term patterns.

📊 Month-over-Month % Change
Calculated growth/decline rates between consecutive months.
Useful to identify seasonal drops and spikes.

🤖 Linear Regression Predictions
Applied a simple regression model to forecast upcoming sales.
Early attempt at predictive analytics.

📦 Product Growth Rate Analysis
Compared product categories based on sales growth trend.
Identified high-performing categories to recommend investment.

💡 Insights & Recommendations

Products with high growth rates → should be prioritized for stocking & promotions.
Categories with stagnant or negative growth → need strategic rethinking (discounts, bundling, or phasing out).
Combining moving averages + growth analysis improves reliability of sales forecasts.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Python – Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, Matplotlib/Seaborn
Data Handling – GroupBy, Rolling, Percent Change, Regression
Visualization – Trend lines, growth comparisons

🚀 Next Step (Day 5): Move towards deeper predictive analytics and explore RFM analysis or clustering customers/products for segmentation.
